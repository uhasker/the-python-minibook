# The Python Minibook

## What is this?

This is the repository for the book "The Python Minibook", a book about Python aimed primarily at beginners.

The live version of the book is [here](https://uhasker.github.io/the-python-minibook).

## Progress

Chapters on the following topics are currently planned:

- [x] Fundementals
- [x] Variables, Data Types and Operators
- [x] Functions
- [x] Classes
- [x] Iterables
- [x] Control Flow
- [x] Exceptions
- [x] Input and Output
- [x] Modules and Packages
- [x] The Project

The first draft of the book is completed and the book is currently in **alpha stage**, i.e. you can read it, but expect some minor mistakes.

## Contributing

We welcome issues & contributions.
If you want to contribute, you can either create an issue or a pull request.
If you create a pull request, **read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` first**.
We will reject PRs that fail to adhere to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` without further review.

**Please do not try to contribute to chapters that are not marked as finished in the progress section.**

We are specifically interested if you find one of the following:

- typos
- grammatical errors
- factual errors
- poor explanations that are unaccessible for beginners
- poor structure within a book section

This list is not exhaustive - if you think that an interesting piece of trivia or a funny joke would add value to this book, don't hesitate to contribute it.

When submitting improvement suggestions, remember that:

- this book should be suitable for beginners, i.e. all new terminology must be explained
- this book maintains an informal tone (and even dares to make jokes) to make it more accessible to a general audience
