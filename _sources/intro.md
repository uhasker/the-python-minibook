# The Python minibook

Always wanted to learn to code, but didn't quite know where to start?
This book is just what you need.

In the first eight chapters, we're going to walk through the ABCs of Python together.
Donâ€™t worry, it's a super friendly language to start with, and weâ€™ve broken things down to keep it light and fun!

And because we all know that doing is the best kind of learning, the last chapter is all about rolling up your sleeves and building a neat little computer game â€“ your very own version of "Breakout"!

Since no one reads forewords anyway and I can already see that youâ€™re eager to roll some code, let's dive right in. ðŸš€
