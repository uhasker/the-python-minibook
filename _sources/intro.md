# The Python Minibook

Always wanted to learn to code, but didn't quite know where to start?
Then this book is for you.

In the first nine chapters, we're going to walk through the ABCs of Python together.

And because we all know that doing is the best kind of learning, the last chapter is all about rolling up your sleeves and building a neat little computer game â€“ your very own version of the Atari "Breakout"!

Since no one reads introductions anyway and we can already see that youâ€™re eager to roll some code, let's dive right in. ðŸš€
