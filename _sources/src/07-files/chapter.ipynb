For example an encoding can decide to represent some characters as a single byte, some characters as two bytes etc. We will not dive into the gritty details of encodings in this chapter since this is not essential to understand (at least not for know). But it *is essential* to realize that the *same code point* can be *converted to a different sequence of bytes depending on the encoding*.\n",
