    "This is actually better than scrambled content which represents a general principle in programming: *It's better to crash than to proceed with invalid data*. The reason for that is simple: If you crash, then at least you know you have an error. If you proceed with invalid data, then you may never know that you have an error until something really bad happens much later. Consider a file that contains bank transactions. If you fail to read this file, then you know that your software has an error and you may try to fix it. But if you proceed with scrambled content, you may process completely wrong transactions resulting in *a lot* of headaches."
