    "Programming is all about *working with data*. Specifically, we need the ability to *store and access* data in the **memory** of our computer. Storing data sounds pretty simple - just write a value to some **memory cell** and be happy. But how do we access the value later?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say, that we are writing a computer game (as we will in the last chapter in this book). We will probably need to store positions and speeds of game objects. For example, we would like to store that the player has a speed of `5` units/second. But if we just write `5` to some memory cell, we will not know what it means later on. It could be the speed of the player, but it could also be the number of eliminated enemies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to *access* our data, we need to store values together with a **symbolic name** that tells us what the value means. For example, we could store the value `5` with the symbolic name `player_speed`. Or we could store the value `5` with the symbolic name `enemies_destroyed`. The value is the same in both cases and yet it refers to two completely different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables allow us to reflect that. Put simply, a **variable** is a *value paired with a symbolic name* that can be used to access that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could store the value `42` somewhere in our memory and pair it with a symbolic name like `the_answer_to_everything`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/variable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers say that the variable `the_answer_to_everything` *has the value* `42`. We are now able to access the value we just stored using the symbolic name `the_answer_to_everything`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the value of a variable changes, its symbolic name stays the same. Let's say that the answer to everything becomes `43` instead of `42` and the variable `the_answer_to_everything` is updated to reflect that:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/variable43.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we access the variable somewhere from our program, we automatically get the *new* value (which is `43`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider another example: We can store the position of a ball in the variable `ball_position` and the speed of the ball in a variable `ball_speed`. If we want to change the position of the ball, we simply update the value of `ball_position` depending on the value of `ball_speed`. Accessing `ball_position` will now yield the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three important things we can do with variables are therefore:\n",
    "1. Create a variable with a symbolic name and an initial value (programmers just say \"*create a variable*\" for short)\n",
    "2. Change (update) the value of the variable using its symbolic name (programmers just say \"*change (update) a variable*\" for short)\n",
    "3. Read the value of the variable using its symbolic name (programmers just say \"*access a variable*\" for short)\n",
